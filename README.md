# Social-Network-Analysis
The script "SocialNetworkAnalysis" analyzes a 100x100 matrix that represents the social Network between 100 people. Each row in the matrix represents a person, while the first column in the matrix represents the sex of the person (used for other analysis options). The program lists the connections each person in the social network has by two degrees of separation. The results are stored in the file, "socialNetworkNeighbors2.dat", with each line in the script representing a person, and the numbers listed in each row represent the connections that the current person has.

The file containing the graph is a graphical representation of the distribution of connections. The x-axis will represents each person, while the y-axis represents the number of connections per person.
